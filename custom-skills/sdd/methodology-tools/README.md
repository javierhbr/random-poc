# Agentic Skill Packs Overview

This directory contains the core intelligence of the Agnostic Agent Loop. These "Skill Packs" provide specialized methodology and workflow guidance, ranging from product discovery to high-scale platform engineering.

## 🛠 The Skill Ecosystem

The ecosystem is designed as a modular toolkit where skills can be chained together or used in isolation depending on the project's scale and risk.

### 🌟 The Main Entry Point: `agentic-helper`
If you are unsure where to start, trigger the **`agentic-helper`**. 
It acts as the **Universal Workflow Consultant** and orchestrator. It will interview you about your goal (Platform vs. Component scale) and recommend the specific skills and CLI commands required for your journey.

### 🗺 Methodology Routing

| Skill | Primary Use Case | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **`unified-sdd`** | Multi-team, platform-scale development combining Sdd-Bmad, Sdd-OpenSpec, and Sdd-Speckit. | **Platform** |
| **`sdd-speckit`** | Turning product briefs and vague ideas into executable plans and task lists. | **Platform/Component** |
| **`sdd-openspec` (op)** | Proposing and implementing well-defined changes using delta specs. | **Component** |
| **`sdd-bmad`** | Progressive planning that routes work by role (Architect/Dev/Verifier). | **Platform/Component** |
| **`atdd` / `tdd`** | Driving implementation through automated acceptance and unit tests. | **Component** |
| **`explain-code`** | Generating visual diagrams and analogies to understand existing architecture. | **Knowledge** |

## 🔄 How They Interact

The skill ecosystem follows a **"Plan-to-Execution"** pipeline:

1.  **Discovery Phase:** Use `product-wizard` to generate a PRD.
2.  **Definition Phase:** Use `sdd-speckit` or `sdd-openspec` to turn the PRD into a technical spec and a list of tasks.
3.  **Context Phase:** Run `agentic-agent context generate <DIR>` to ensure the agent understands local rules.
4.  **Implementation Phase:** Use `run-with-ralph` or `atdd` to iterate on the code.
5.  **Validation Phase:** Run `agentic-agent validate` to ensure the final output matches the spec.

## 📝 Usage Samples

### Example 1: Building a New Feature from Scratch
> "I want to build a new payment gateway. Guide me."
1. Trigger **`product-wizard`** to define the requirements.
2. Trigger **`sdd-speckit`** to create the execution plan and tasks.
3. Use **`agentic-agent task claim`** to start the implementation.

### Example 2: Mapping a Large Brownfield Platform
> "We have a massive legacy monorepo. How do we start using SDD?"
1. Trigger **`platform-contextualizer`** to document the current state.
2. Trigger **`unified-sdd`** to establish the platform-wide engineering constitution.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Which skill is the most important?
**A:** `agentic-helper`. It is the brain that knows how to use all the other skills. It should be your first point of contact for any workflow questions.

### Q: Can I use multiple skills at once?
**A:** No. Following the **Prime Directive** in `SKILLS.md`, you should trigger **one skill per invocation**. If a task requires multiple skills, split it into sequential steps (e.g., first define the spec with `sdd-speckit`, then implement it with `atdd`).

### Q: What is the difference between Platform and Component scope?
**A:** **Platform** scope deals with multi-team standards, shared context, and cross-cutting architectures. **Component** scope is focused on the implementation of a specific service, library, or feature within that platform.

### Q: How do skills connect to the CLI?
**A:** Skills provide the **logic and strategy**. The `agentic-agent` CLI provides the **physical actions** (creating tasks, claiming branches, generating context files, and validating changes). Always use the CLI to track the work recommended by the skills.
